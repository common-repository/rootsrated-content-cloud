Yet Chilhowee is a hidden gem, as worthy of a visit as the well-known neighboring \u003ca href=\"https://rootsrated.com/chattanooga-tn/mountain-biking/tanasi\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTanasi\u003c/a\u003e / Brush Creek trails at the Ocoee Whitewater Center.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"fr-tag\"\u003eWe recommend parking at the Clemmer Trailhead, at the foot of the mountain, then beginning your ride by climbing all the way up the Clemmer Trail to the first signed junction. Here, take a left to continue onto the Slickrock Laurel Loop and climb until it merges with an old forest road; stay to the right here, then take a sharp left at the sign onto the Slickrock Hancock Loop.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"fr-tag\"\u003eThe trail turns to singletrack here, with some steep sections, and you’ll reach the high point of your climb at about the 4 mile mark. Continue on a fun, rocky downhill until you reach a grassy road, then take a right and follow the road to a clearing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"fr-tag\"\u003eOnce at Benton Falls, you have a couple of options. First, we highly recommend walking your bike down to the falls themselves if you’ve never been. Those who prefer a shorter ride can cruise back to Clemmer and blast downhill from there, returning to the vehicle the way you came. If you still have some leg remaining, take a left and ride out to the campground, then cross the parking lot and hop onto Azalea at the sign. Ride Azalea to its conclusion and follow the Clear Creek Trail from there until you reach the T-junction.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"fr-tag\"\u003eOne more decision to make. Do you want to ride down the gorge and back up the other side on Rim Rock, then finish with Clemmer, or do you want to drop off the eastern brow of the mountain on the Clear Creek Trail? If the former, take a right and get to it. Rim Rock heads straight back to the Benton Falls Trail, with a picturesque creek crossing at the bottom. A left brings you back to Clemmer; add in the Rim Rock Spur loop (on your left) if you want one more quick hit of narrow singletrack.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"fr-tag\"\u003eIf you prefer the Clear Creek route: Clear Creek involves a steep climb, a few fun rock gardens, some seriously gnarly and technical terrain that will have most riders walking a short stretch or two, then some fast-and-loose descending with a couple of wide creek crossings at the bottom. It’s wonderful, but it’s for advanced riders only. Proceed with caution!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"fr-tag\"\u003eFrom this clearing, there are three ways to go: far left is the upper part of the Naked Widow loop, middle is the lower part of Naked Widow, and the far right-hand option is the conclusion of the Hancock Loop. All three are fun, and the middle option is the rockiest and most technical. Both sides of Naked Widow intersect with Benton Falls; Hancock returns to a forest road, and you’ll need to go left and ride downhill a bit longer before reaching the Benton Falls Trail. At the end of the trail, you’ll intersect highway 30. Take a right, follow the pavement past the Parksville Lake Campground, and you’ll find yourself right back at the parking lot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWho is Going to Love It\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"fr-tag\"\u003eChilhowee is a bit of a time capsule. It harkens back to a time when trails were hand-built and mountain bikes had 26” wheels. Beginners with the right attitude will have fun here, but expect soaring heart rates and the occasional short hike-a-bike. There is a sort of “Western North Carolina” feel to these trails, from the thick bands of rhododendron and mountain laurel to the Pisgah-esque feel here and there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"fr-tag\"\u003eWho will like it? Anyone who likes riding on raw, old-school trail without buffed grade reversals and bermed turns. A mile away from either trailhead, it’s easy to feel like you’re the only person in the forest, an experience which is difficult to replicate at any of the trail systems in town.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"fr-tag\"\u003eEndurance riders will find no shortage of gravel forest roads to link with the trail system here, most notably the long slog from the campground north to Oswald Dome where encountering traffic is relatively rare.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eDirections, Parking, \u0026 Regulations\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"fr-tag\"\u003eFrom Chattanooga, take I-75 north to exit 20 and take a right onto highway 64.
